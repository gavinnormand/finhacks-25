# Scholar Saver 💵

Scholar Saver is a full-stack personal finance web app aimed at helping students manage their finances.
It allows users to enter their expenses and keeps separate track of personal and educational expenses.
It then serves up data visualizations to display how users spend their money.

It was built as part of the 2025 FinHacks hackathon and was each group member's first-ever full-stack web development experience.
