# Scholar Saver ðŸ’µ

Scholar saver is a full-stack personal finance web app aimed to help students manage their finances. 
It allows users to enter their expenses and keeps seperate track of personal and educational expenses. 
It then serves up data visualizations to display how you spend your money. 
It was built as a part of the 2025 FinHacks hackaton and was each of the group members' first ever full-stack web dev experience.

This project is not deployed anywhere, however here is some screenshots of it's functionality.
